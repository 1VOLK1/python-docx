If Word complains:
- Ensure the same file isn't included twice in your zip archive. Zip supports this, Word doesn't.
- Check your namespaces - on both the tags, and the attributes
- Check capitalization of tag names

One common debugging technique we've used before
- Re-save the document to fix it
- Unzip and grabbing the serialized XML out of the file
- Use etree.fromstring() to turn it into an element, and include that in your code.
- Check that a correct file is generated
- Remove an element from your string-created etree (including both opening and closing tags)
- Use element.append(makelement()) to add that element to your tree
- Open the doc in Word and see if it still works
- Repeat the last three steps until you discover which element is causing the prob
