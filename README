Read and writes Microsoft Word 2007/Microsoft Mac Office 2008 docx files.

These are referred to as 'Office Open XML' and 'Open XML' by Microsoft although that spec does not have anything to do with the pre-existing OpenOffice file format. 

Pure Python / XML / XPath. Does not use any desktop-era tools:
- Does not use Microsoft Office or OpenOffice (too ugly)
- Does not use COM, .net or Java (too stinky)
Just Python. Runs happily on your webserver.

Features:
- 100% Native Python. Works on all Python platforms.
- Can add paragraphs, multiple levels of headings, and tables
- Can get all text out of a document
- Support for adding arbitrary elements in included via makelement(), which creates XML elements with required Word namespaces in their tag names and attributes
